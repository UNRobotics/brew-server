# brew-server [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/UNRobotics/brew-server/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/UNRobotics/brew-server)
Software that logs temperature data from a Raspberry Pi running brew-node

# Purpose
The purpose of this software is to receive and record into a data base a temperature from a brewery tank. This is recorded for the purpose of ensuring quality of the brew.

# Infrastructure
The node it is recording from will be on the same network, and will be sending it via REST API to be recorded. The node can be anything from a Raspberry Pi to Arduino, as long as it follows the specifications.
